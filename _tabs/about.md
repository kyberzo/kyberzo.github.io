## /WHOAMI

A cybersecurity professional with experience in Cybersecurity Operations and Threat Research with a deep technical focus on safeguarding digital ecosystems and empowering organisations to navigate an ever-evolving threat landscape. I combine advanced threat analysis with architectural insight to deliver resilient, scalable security solutions.

I specialise in dissecting complex attack vectors, reverse engineering malware, and translating threat intelligence into actionable defence strategies. Whether I’m conducting research, building detection systems, or mentoring emerging cyber talent, I bring a rigorous, analytical approach to every challenge.

I work hands-on with tools like Wireshark for network protocol analysis, Splunk for scalable log and SIEM analytics, and IDA Pro for deep reverse engineering. I also align my threat detection and response strategies with the MITRE ATT&CK Framework to ensure comprehensive coverage of adversary tactics and techniques. I integrate automation into my workflows to accelerate threat detection and reduce response time—whether through custom scripts, automated malware sandboxing, or machine learning models for predictive threat detection. I design and train machine learning models using techniques such as supervised classification and clustering to identify malicious patterns in telemetry data, extracted data or file features (feature engineering) and behavioural signals. 

Currently expanding cybersecurity knowledge in the field of 5G Security, Cloud Security, AI Security and OT/ICS Security.
